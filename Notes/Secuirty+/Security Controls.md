## Categories of Controls
- Technical Controls
	- Controls implemented using some kind of system
		- OS system controls
		- Firewalls, anti-virus
- Managerial Controls
	- Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
		- Security policies, SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
- Operational Controls
	- Controls implemented by people
		- Security guards, awareness programs (lunch & learns)
- Physical Controls
	- Limit physical access
		- Guard shacks
		- Fences or locks
		- Badge readers
## Control Type Examples
- Preventive Control
	- Block access to a resource
	- Examples:
		- Technical - firewall rule
		- Managerial - on-boarding policy
		- Operational - guard shack
		- Physical - door lock
- Deterrent Control
	- Discourage an intrusion attempt.
	- Does not directly prevent access
	- Examples:
		- Technical - application splash screen
		- Managerial - threat of demotion
		- Operational - front reception desk
		- Physical - posted warning signs
- Detective Control
	- Identify and log an intrusion attempt
	- May not prevent access
	- Examples:
		- Technical - collecting and reviewing system logs
		- Managerial - review login reports
		- Operational - patrol on property
		- Physical - motion detectors
- Corrective Control
	- Apply a control after an event has been detected
	- May reverse the impact of an event and allow continual operation with minimal downtime'
	- Examples:
		- Technical - restoring from backups can mitigate a ransomware infection
		- Managerial - create policies for reporting security issues
		- Operational - contact authorities
		- Physical - fire extinguisher
- Compensating Control

		- Managerial - create compliance policies and procedures
		- Operational - train users on proper security policies
		- Physical - post sign for "Authorized Personnel Only"
## Final Thoughts
- Some security controls exist in multiple types of categories
- New security controls are created as systems and processes evolve
- Some organizations combine types
