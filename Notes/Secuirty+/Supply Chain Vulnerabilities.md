	- Infect different parts of the chain without suspicion
	- People trust their suppliers
- One exploit can infect the entire chain
	- There's a lot at stake
## Service providers

- Service providers often have access to internal services
	- An opportunity for the attacker
- Many different types of providers
	- Network, utility, office cleaning, payroll/accounting, cloud services, system administration, etc.
