## Software updates
- Always keep your operating system and applications updated
	- Updates often include bug fixes and security patches
- This process has its own security concerns
	- Not every update is equally secure
- Follow best practices
	- Always have a known good backup
	- Install from trusted sources
## Downloading and updating
- Install updates from a downloaded file
	- Always consider your actions
	- Every installation could potentially be malicious
- Confirm the source
	- A random pop-up during web browsing may not be legitimate
- Visit the developer's site directly
	- Don't trust a random update button or random downloaded file
- Many operating systems will only allow signed apps
	- Don't disable your security controls
## Automatic updates

	- Often includes security checks/digital signatures
- Relatively trustworthy
	- Comes directly from the developer
