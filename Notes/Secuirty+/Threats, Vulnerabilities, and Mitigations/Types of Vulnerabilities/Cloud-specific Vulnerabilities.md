## Security in the cloud
- Cloud adoption has been nearly universal
	- It's difficult to find a company NOT using the cloud
- We've put sensitive data in the cloud
- We're not putting in the right protections
	- 76% of organizations aren't using MFA for management console users
- Simple best-practices aren't being used
	- 63% of code in production is unpatched
	- Vulnerabilities rated high or critical (CVSS >= 7.0)
## Attack the services
- Denial of Service (DoS)
	- Fundamental attack type
	- Uses a single source to overload a server, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
	- Attack that employs multiple compromised devices (a botnet) to overwhelm the target, making it harder to detect and defend against
- Authentication bypass
	- Take advantage of weak or faulty authentication
- Directory traversal
	- Faulty configurations put data at risk
- Remote code execution
	- Take advantage of unpatched systems
## Attack the application
- Web application attacks have increased
	- Log4j and Spring Cloud Function
	- East to exploit, rewards are extensive
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
	- Take advantage of poor input validation
- Out of bounds write
	- Write to unauthorized memory areas
	- Data corruption, crashing, or code execution
- SQL injection
	- Get direct access to a database
