## Multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Prove who you are
	- Use different methods
		- A memorized password
		- A mobile app
		- Your GPS location
- Factors
	- Something you know
	- Something you have
	- Something you are
	- Somewhere you are
- There are other factors as well
## Something you know
- Password
	- Secret word/phrase, string of characters
	- Very common authentication factor
- PIN
	- Personal Identification Number
	- Not typically contained anywhere on a smart card or ATM card
- Pattern
	- Complete a series of patterns
	- Only you know the right format
## Something you have
- Smart card
	- Integrates with devices
	- May require a PIN
- USB security key
	- Certificate is on the USB device
- Hardware or software tokens
	- Generates a pseudo-random authentication codes
- Your phone
	- SMS a code to your phone
## Something you are
- Biometric authentication
	- Fingerprint, iris scan, voice print
- Usually stores a mathematical representation of your biometric
	- Your actual fingerprint isn't usually saved
- Difficult to change
	- You can change your password
	- You can't change your fingerprint
- Used in very specific situations
	- Not foolproof
## Somewhere you are
- Provide a factor based on your location
	- The transaction only competes if you are in a particular geography
- IP address
	- Not perfect, but can help provide more info
	- Works with IPv4, not so much with IPv6
- Mobile device location services
	- Geolocation to a very specific area
	- Must be in a location that can receive GPS information or near an identifiable mobile or 802.11 network
	- Still not a perfect identifier of location
