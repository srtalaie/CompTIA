## Password complexity and length
- Make your password strong
	- Resist guessing or brute-force attack
- Increase password entropy or how difficult guessing a password might be
	- No single words, no obvious passwords
	- Mix upper and lower case, letters, and special characters
- Stronger passwords are commonly at least 8 characters
	- These requirements change as processing speed gets faster
	- Consider a phrase or set of words
## Password age and expiration
- Password age
	- How log since a password was modified
- Password expiration
	- Password works for a certain amount of time
	- 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.
	- After the expiration date, the password does not work
	- System remembers password history, requires unique passwords
- Critical systems might change more frequently
	- Every 15 days or every week
## Password managers
- Important to use different passwords for each account
- Store all of your passwords in a single database
	- Encrypted, protected
	- Can include multifactor tokens
- Built-in tom many operating systems
	- And some browsers
- Enterprise password managers
	- Centralized management and recovery options
## Passwordless authentication
- Many breaches are due to poor password control
	- Weak passwords, insecure implementation
- Authenticate without a password
	- This solves many password management issues
- You may already be passwordless
	- Facial recognition, security key, etc.
- Passwordless may not be the primary authentication method
	- Used with a password or additional factors
## Just-in-time permissions
- In many organizations, the IT team is assigned administrator/root elevated account rights
- Grant admin access for a limited time instead
	- No permanent administrator rights
	- The principle of least privilege
- A breached user account never has elevated rights
	- Narrow the scope of the breach
- Process:
	- Request access from a central clearinghouse
		- Grants or denies based on predefined security policies
	- Password vaulting
		- Primary credentials are stored in a password vault
		- The vault controls who gets access t credentials
	- Accounts are temporary
		- Just-in-time process creates a time-limited account
		- Administrator receives ephemeral credentials
		- Primary passwords are never released
		- Credentials are used for one session then deleted
