## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Applications are available anywhere
	- Desktop, browser mobile device, etc.
- Data can be located anywhere
	- Cloud storage, private data centers, etc.
- Many different application users
	- Employees, vendors, contractors customers
- Give the permissions to the right people at the right time
	- Prevent unauthorized access
- Identify lifecycle management
	- Every entity (human and non-human) gets a digital identity
- Access control
	- An entity only gets access to what they need
- Authentication and authorization
	- Entities must prove they are who they claim to be
- Identity governance
	- Track an entity's resource access
	- May be a regulatory requirement
## Provisioning/de-provisioning user accounts
- The user account creation process
	- And the account removal process
- Provisioning and de-provisioning occurs for certain events
	- Hiring, transfers, promotions, job separation
- Account details
	- Name, attributes, group permissions, other permissions
- An important part of the IAM process
	- An initial checkpoint to limit access
	- Nobody gets Administrator access
## Permission assignments
- Each entity gets limited permissions
	- Just enough to do their job
	- Group assignments are common
- Storage and files can be private to that user
	- Even if another person is using the same computer
- No privileged access to the operating system
	- Specifically not allowed on a user account
## Identity proofing
- I could be anyone
	- The IAM process should confirm who I am
- Resolution
	- Who the system thinks you are
- Validation
	- Gathering information from the user (password, security questions, etc.)
- Verification/Attestation
	- Passport, in-person meeting, etc.
	- Automated verification is also an option
## Single sign on (SSO)
- Provide credential one time
	- Get access to all available or assigned resources
	- No additional authentication required
- Usually limited by time
	- A single authentication can work for 24 hours
	- Authenticate again after the timer expires
- The underlying authentication infrastructure must support SSO
	- Not always an option
## LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network
	- An organized set of records, like a phone directory
- X.500 specification was written by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
- DAP ran on the OSI protocol stack
- LDAP is the protocol used to query and update an X.500 directory
	- Used in Windows Active Directory, Apple OpenDirectory, Novell eDriectroy, etc.
## X.500 Distinguished Names
- attribute=value pairs
- Most specific attribute is listed first
	- This may be similar to the way you already think
- X.500 Directory Information Tree
	- Hierarchical structure
		- Builds a tree
	- Container objects
		- Country, organization, organizational unites
	- Leaf objects
		- Users, computers, printers, files
## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
- Open standard for authentication and authorization
	- You can authenticate through a third-party to gain access
	- One standard does it all
- Not originally designed for mobile apps
	- This has been SAML's largest roadblock
- Authentication Flow
	- Client device - the one you are using
	- Resource server - what you are trying to access
	- Authentication server - what will be authenticating the client for access
	- Starts with the client accessing the application URL on the resource serve
	- Since the user is not logged in the resource server sends signed/encrypted SAML request, redirects the user to the authorization server
	- User logs in
	- Authentication successful, SAML token generated and sent to the client as a copy
	- Client sends the copy to the resource server
	- Resource server verifies the token and grants access
## OAuth
- Authorization framework
	- Determines what resources a user will be able to access
- Created by Twitter, Google, and many others
	- Significant industry support
- Not an authentication protocol
	- OpenID Connect handles the single sign-on authentication
	- OAuth provides authorization between applications
## Federation
- Provide network access to others
	- Not just employees - Partners, suppliers, customers, etc.
	- Provide SSO and more
- Third-parties can establish a federated network
	- Authenticate and authorize between two organizations
	- Login with your Facebook credentials
- The third-parties must establish a trust relationship
	- And the degree of the trust
## Interoperability
- The ability of different products and services to work together seamlessly
- Many different ways to communicate with an authentication server
	- More than a simple login process
- Often determined by what is at hand
	- VPN concentrator can talk to a LDAP server
	- We have an LDAP server
- A new app uses OAuth
	- Need to allow authentication API access
- The interoperability is dependent on the environment
	- This is often part of a much larger IAM strategy
