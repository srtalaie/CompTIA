## Vulnerability scanning
- Usually minimally invasive
	- Unlike a penetration test
- Port scan
	- Informs on what ports are open/closed
- Identify systems
	- And security devices
- Test from the outside and inside
	- Don't dismiss insider threats
- Gather as much information as possible
	- Not everything is accurate, can have false positives
## Static code analyzer
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
	- Help to identify security flaws
- Many security vulnerabilities found easily
	- Buffer overflows, database injections, etc.
- Not everything can be identified through analysis
	- Authentication security, insecure cryptography, etc.
	- Don't rely on automation for everything
- Still have to verify each finding
	- False positives are an issue
## Dynamic analysis (fuzzing)
- Send random input to a n application
	- Fault-injecting, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing
- Looking for something out of the ordinary
	- Application crash, server error, exception
- 1988 class project at the University of Wisconsin
	- "Operating System Utility Program Reliability" class
	- Professor Barton Miller
	- The Fuzz Generator
## Fuzzing engines and frameworks
- Many different fuzzing options
	- Platform specific, language specific, etc.
- Very time and processor resource heavy
	- Many different iterations to try
	- Many fuzzing engines use high-probability tests
- Carnegie Mellon Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)

## Package monitoring
- Some applications are distributed in a package
	- Especially open source
	- Supply chain integrity
- Confirm the package is legitimate
	- Trusted source
	- No added malware
	- No embedded vulnerabilities
- Confirm a safe package before deployment
	- Verify the contents
