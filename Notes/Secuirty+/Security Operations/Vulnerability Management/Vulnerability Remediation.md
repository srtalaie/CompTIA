## Patching
- The most common mitigation technique
	- We know the vulnerability exists
	- We have a patch file to install
- Scheduled vulnerability/patch notices
	- Monthly/quarterly
- Unscheduled patches
	- Zero day, often urgent
- This is an ongoing priocess
	- The patches keep coming
	- An easy way to prevent most exploits
## Insurance
- Cybersecurity insurance coverage; happens usually after the attack occurs
	- Lost revenue
	- Data recovery costs
	- Money lost to phishing
	- Privacy lawsuit costs
- Doesn't cover everything
	- Intentional acts, fund transfers, etc.
- Ransomware has increased popularity of cybersecurity liability insurance
	- Applies to every organization
## Segmentation
- Limit the scope of an exploit
	- Separate devices into their own networks/VLANs
- A breach would have limited scope
	- It's not as bas as it could be
- Can't patch?
	- Disconnect from the world
	- Air gaps may be required
- Use internal NGFWs
	- Block unwanted/unnecessary traffic between VLANs
	- Identify malicious traffic on the inside
## Physical segmentation
- Separate devices
	- Multiple units, separate infrastructure
## Logical segmentation with VLANs
- Allow you to logically assign interfaces on the switch to one particular network or another
- Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)
	- Separated logically instead of physically
	- Cannot communicate between VLANs without a Layer 3 device/router
## Compensating controls
- Optimal security methods may not be available
	- Can't deploy a patch right now
	- No internal firewalls
- Compensate in other ways
	- Disable the problematic service
	- Revoke access to the application
	- Limit external access
	- Modify internal security controls and software firewalls
- Provide coverage until a patch is deployed
	- Or similar optimal security response
## Exceptions and exemptions
- Removing the vulnerability is optimal
	- But not everything can be patched
- A balancing act
	- Provide the service, but also protect the data and systems
- Not all vulnerabilities share the same severity
	- May require local login, physical access, or other criteria
- An exception may be an option
	- Usually a formal process to approve
## Validation of remediation
- The vulnerability is now patched
	- Does the patch really stop the exploit?
	- Did you patch all vulnerable systems
- Rescanning
	- Perform an extensive vulnerability scan
- Audit
	- Check remediated systems to ensure the patch was successfully deployed
- Verification
	- Manually confirm the security of the system
## Reporting
- Ongoing checks are required
	- New vulnerabilities are continuously discovered
- Difficult (or impossible) to manage without automation
	- Manual checks would be time consuming
- Continuous reporting
	- Number of identified vulnerabilities
	- Systems patched vs. unpatched
	- New threat notifications
	- Errors, exceptions, and exemptions
