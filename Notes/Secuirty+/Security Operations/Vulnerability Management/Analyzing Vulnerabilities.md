## Dealing with false information
- False positives
	- A vulnerability is identified that doesn't really exist
- This is different than a low-severity vulnerability
	- It's real, but may not be your highest priority
- False negatives
	- A vulnerability exists, but you didn't detect it
- Update to the latest signatures
	- If you don't know about it, you can't see it
- Work with the vulnerability detection manufacturer
	- They may need to update their signatures for you environment
## Prioritizing vulnerabilities
- Not every vulnerability shares the same priority
	- Some may not be significant
	- Others may be critical
- This can be difficult to determine
	- The research has probably already been done
- Refer to public disclosures and vulnerability databases
	- The industry is well versed
	- Online discussion groups, public disclosure mailing lists
## CVSS
- [National Vulnerability Database](http://nvd.nist.gov/)
	- Synchronized with the CVE list
	- Enhanced search functionality
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
	- Quantitative scoring of a vulnerability - 0 to 10
	- The scoring standards change over time
	- Different scoring for CVSS 2.0 vs. CVSS 3.x
- Industry collaboration
	- Enhanced feed sharing and automation
## CVE
- The vulnerabilities can be cross-referenced online
	- Almost all scanners give you a place to go
- [National Vulnerability Database](http://nvd.nist.gov/)
- [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/)
- [Microsoft Security Bulletins](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx)
- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified
	- You'll have to check manually to see if a system is vulnerable
	- The scanner gives you a heads up
## Vulnerability classification
- The scanner looks for everything
	- Signatures are key
- Application scans
	- Desktop, mobile apps
- Web application scans
	- Software on a web server
- Network scans
	- Misconfigured firewalls, open ports, vulnerable devices
## Exposure factor
- Loss of value or business activity if the vulnerability is exploited
	- Usually referenced as a percentage
		- A small DDoS may limit access to a service for half the time
			- 50% exposure factor
		- A buffer overflow may completely disable a service
			- 100% exposure factor
- A consideration when prioritizing
	- Worst possible outcome probably gets priority
## Environmental variables
- What type of environment is associated with this vulnerability?
	- Internal server, public cloud, test lab
- Prioritization and patching frequency
	- A device in an isolated test lab
	- A database server in the public cloud
	- Which environment get priority?
- Every environment is different
	- Number and type of users (internal, external)
	- Revenue generating application
	- Potential for exploit
## Industry/organizational impact
- Some exploits have significant consequences
	- The type of organization is an important consideration
- Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare - February 2023
	- Ransomware - closed for two weeks
	- Diverted emergency cases, surgeries cancelled
- Power utilities - Salt Lake City, Utah and LA County, California - March 2019
	- DDoS attacks from an unpatched known vulnerability
## Risk tolerance
- The amount of risk acceptable to an organization
	- It's impractical to remove all risk
- The timing of security patches
	- Patching immediately doesn't allow for proper testing
- Testing takes time
	- While you're testing, you're also vulnerable
- There's a middle ground
	- May change based on severity
