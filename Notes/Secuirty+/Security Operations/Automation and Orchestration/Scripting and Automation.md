## Scripting and automation
- Automate and orchestrate
	- You don't have to be there
	- Monitor and resolve problems before they happen
- The need for speed
	- The script is as fast as the computer
	- No typing delays
	- No human error
- Automate mundane tasks
	- You can do something more creative
## Automation benefits
- Save time
	- No typing required
	- Run multiple times over and over
- Enforce baselines
	- Missing an important security patch?
	- Automatically install when identified
- Standard infrastructure configurations
	- Use a script to build a default router configuration
	- Add firewall rules to a new security appliance
	- IP configurations, security rules, standard configuration options
- Secure scaling
	- Orchestrate cloud resources
	- Quickly scale up and down
	- Automation ensures proper security also scales
- Employee retention
	- Automate the boring stuff
	- Ease the workload
	- Minimize the mundane tasks
	- Employees work is rewarding instead of repetitive
- Reaction time
	- The computer is much faster than you
	- An event can be addressed immediately
	- A script doesn't need a wake up call
- Workforce multiplier
	- Scripting works 24/7
	- Allows the smart people to do smarter work somewhere else
## Cases for automation
- User and resource provisioning
	- On-boarding and off-boarding
	- Assign access to specific resources
- Guard rails
	- A set of automated validations
	- Limit behaviors and responses
	- Constantly check to ensure proper implementation
	- Reduce errors
- Security groups
	- Assign (or remove) group access
	- Constant audits without human intervention
- Ticket creation
	- Automatically identify issues
	- Script emails submissions into a ticket
- Escalation
	- Correct issue before involving humans
	- If issue isn't resolved, contact the on-call tech
- Controlling services and access
	- Automatically enable and disable services
	- No set and forget
- Continuous integration and testing
	- Constant development and code updates
	- Securely test and deploy
- Integrations and application programming interfaces (APIs)
	- Interact with third-party devices and services
	- Cloud services, firewalls, operating systems
	- Talk their language
## Scripting considerations
- Complexity
	- Many moving parts
	- All of the parts have to reliably work together
- Cost
	- It takes money to create the script
	- It takes money to implement the automation
- Single point of failure
	- What happens if the script stops working
	- Could be a significant deal-breaker
- Technical debt
	- Patching problems may push the issue down the road
	- It's going to be more expensive to fix later
- Ongoing supportability
	- The scrip works great today but may not work great tomorrow
	- Plan for changes and updates
