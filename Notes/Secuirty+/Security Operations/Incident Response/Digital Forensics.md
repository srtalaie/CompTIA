## Digital forensics
- Collect an protect information relating to an intrusion
	- Many different data sources and protection mechanisms
- RFC 3227 - Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving
	- A good set of best practices
- Standard digital forensics process
	- Acquisition, analysis, reporting
- Must be detail oriented
	- Take extensive notes
## Legal hold
- A legal technique to preserve relevant information
	- Prepare for impending litigation
	- Initiated by legal counsel
- Hold notification
	- Custodians are instructed to preserve data
- Separate repository for electronically stored information
	- Many different different data sources and types
	- Unique workflow and retention requirements
- Ongoing preservation
	- Once notified, there's an ongoing obligation to preserve data
## Chain of custody
- Control evidence
	- Maintain integrity
- Everyone who contacts the evidence
	- Use hashes and digital signatures
	- Avoid tampering
- Label and catalog everything
	- Digitally tag all items for ongoing documentation
	- Seal and store
## Acquisition
- Obtain the data
	- Disk, RAM, firmware, OS files, etc.
- Some of the data may not be on a single system
	- Servers, network data, firewall logs
- For virtual systems, get a snapshot
	- Contains all files and information about a VM
- Look for any left-behind digital items
	- Artifacts
	- Log information, recycle bins, browser bookmarks, saved logins, etc.
## Reporting
- Document the findings
	- For internal use, legal proceedings, etc.
- Summary information
	- Overview of the security event
- Detailed explanation of data acquisition
	- Step-by-step method of the process
- The findings
	- An analysis of the data
- Conclusion
	- Professional results, given the analysis
## Preservation
- Handling evidence
	- Isolate and protect the data
	- Analyze the data later without any alterations
- Manage the collection process
	- Work from copies
	- Manage the data collection from mobile devices
- Live collection has become an important skill
	- Data may be encrypted or difficult to collect after powering down
- Follow best practices to ensure admissibility of data in court
	- What happens now affects the future
## E-discovery
- Electronic discovery
	- Collect, prepare, review, interpret, and produce electronic documents
- E-discovery gathers data required by the legal process
	- Does not generally involve analysis
	- There's no consideration of intent
- Works together with digital forensics
	- The e-discovery process obtains a storage drive
	- Data on the drive is smaller than expected
	- Forensics experts determine that data was deleted and attempt to recover the data
