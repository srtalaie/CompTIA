## The endpoint
- The user's access
	- Applications and data
- Stop the attackers
	- Inbound attacks
	- Outbound attacks
- Many different platforms
	- Mobile, desktop
- Protection is multi-faceted
	- Defense in depth
## Edge vs. access control
- Control at the edge
	- Your internet link
	- Managed primarily though firewall rules
	- Firewall rule rarely change
- Access control
	- Control from wherever you are
		- Inside or outside
	- Access can be based on many rules
		- By user, group, location, application, etc.
	- Access can be easily revoked or changed
		- Change your security posture at any time
## Posture assessment
- You can't trust everyone's computer
	- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)
	- Malware infections/missing anti-malware
	- Unauthorized applications
- Before connecting to the network, perform a health check
	- Is it a trusted device?
	- Is it running anti-virus? Which one? Is it updated?
	- Are the corporate applications installed?
	- Is it a mobile device? Is the disk encrypted?
	- The type of device doesn't matter - Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android
## Health checks/posture assessment
- Persistent agents
	- Permanently installed onto a system
	- Periodic updates may be required
- Dissolvable agents
	- No installation is required
	- Runs during the posture assessment
	- Terminates when no longer required
- Agentless NAC
	- Integrated with Active Directory
	- Checks are made during login and logoff
	- Can't be scheduled
## Failing your assessment
- What happens when a posture assessment fails
	- Too dangerous to allow access
- Quarantine network, notify administrators
	- Just enough network access to fix the issue
- Once resolved, try again
	- May require additional fixes
## Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- A different method of threat protection
	- Scale to meet the increasing number of threats
- Detect a threat
	- Signatures aren't the only detection tool
	- Behavioral analysis, machine learning, process monitoring
	- Lightweight agent on the endpoint
- Investigate the treat
	- Root cause analysis
- Respond to the threat
	- Isolate the system, quarantine the threat, rollback to a previous config
	- API driven, no user or technician intervention required
## Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
- An evolution of EDR
	- Improve missed detections, false positives, and long investigation times
	- Attacks involve more than just the endpoint
- Add network based detection
	- Investigate and respond to network anomalies
- Correlate endpoint, network, and cloud data
	- Improve detection rates
	- Simplify security event investigations
## User behavior analytics
- XDR commonly includes user behavior analytics
	- Extend the scope of anomaly detection
- Watch users, hosts, network traffic, data repositories, etc.
	- Create a baseline or normal activity
	- Requires data analysis over an extended period
- Watch for anything unusual
	- Use a set of rules, pattern matching, statistical analysis
- Real-time detection of unusual activity
	- Catch the threat early
