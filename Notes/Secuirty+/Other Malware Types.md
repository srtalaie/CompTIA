## Keyloggers
- Your keystrokes contain valuable information
	- Web site login URLs, passwords, email messages
- Save all of your input and send it to the attacker
- Circumvent encryption protections
	- Your keystrokes are in the clear
- Other data logging
	- Clipboard logging, screen logging, instant messaging, search engine queries
## Logic bomb
- Waits for a predefined event
	- Often left by someone with a grudge
- Time bomb
	- Time or date
- User event
	- Logic bomb
- Difficult to identify
	- Difficult to recover if it goes off
	- No anti-virus/anti-malware signature because it is so unique
## Real-world logic bombs
- March 19, 2013, South Korea
	- Email with malicious attachment sent to South Korean organizations
	- Posed as a bank email
	- Trojan installs malware
- March 20, 2013, 2 P.M. local time
	- Malware time-based logic bomb activates
	- Storage and master boot record deleted, system reboots
- Logic bomb wiped entire bank systems, rendering it inoperable
	- ex/ ATMs
- If you tried using the ATMs after the bomb you saw:
	- Boot device not found. Please install an operating system on our hard disk
## Preventing a logic bomb
- Difficult to recognize
	- Each is unique
	- No predefined signatures
- Process and procedures
	- Formal change control
- Electronic monitoring
	- Alert on changes
	- Host based intrusion detection, Tripwire, etc.
- Constant auditing
	- An administrator can circumvent existing systems
## Rootkits
- Originally a Unix technique
	- The "root" in rootkit
- Modifies core system files
	- Part of the kernel making it part of the OS itself
- Can be invisible to the operating system
	- Won't see it in Task Manager
- Also invisible to traditional anti-virus utilities
	- If you can't see it, you can't stop it
## Finding and removing rootkits
- Look for the unusual
	- Ant-malware scans
	- Only works if they are not part of the kernel
- Use a remover specific to the rootkit
	- Usually built after the rootkit is discovered
- Secure boot with UEFI
	- Security in the BIOS
	- Will look for an OS signature and confirm nothing has changed within the kernel before starting
