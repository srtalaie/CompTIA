## Security standards
- A formal definition for using security technologies and processes
	- Complete documentation reduces security risk
	- Everyone understands the expectations
- These may be written in-house
	- Your requirements may be unique
- Many standards are already available
	- ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
	- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
## Passwords
- What makes a good password?
	- Every organization has their own requirements
	- Create a formal password complexity policy
- Define acceptable authentication methods
	- No local accounts, only LDAP to the AD database, etc.
- Create policies for secure password resets
	- Avoid unauthorized resets and access
- Other password policies
	- Password change frequency, secure password storage requirements, password manager options, etc.
## Access control
- How does an organization control access to data?
	- Determine which information , at what time
	- And under which circumstances
- Define which access control types can be used
	- No discretionary, mandatory only, etc.
- Determine how a user gets access
	- Require privilege documentation
- Document how access may be removed
	- Security issue, expiration, contract renewals, etc.
## Physical security
- Rules and policies regarding physical security controls
	- Doors, building access, property security
- Granting physical access
	- Different for employees vs. visitors
- Define specific physical security systems
	- Electronic door locks, ongoing monitoring, motion detection, etc.
- Additional security concerns
	- Mandatory escorts, off-boarding, etc.
## Encryption
- Define specific standards for encrypting and securing data
	- All things cryptographic
	- Can include implementations standards
- Password storage
	- Methods and techniques
- Data encryption minimums
	- Algorithms for data in use/transit/rest
	- Will probably be different for each data state
