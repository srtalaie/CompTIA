## Recovery
- Recovery time objective (RTO)
	- Get up and running quickly
	- Get back to a particular service level
	- You're not up and running until the database and web server are operational
	- The time it takes to do that is the RTO
- Recovery point objective (RPO)
	- Point in time where you can say you are up and running
		- How much data loss is acceptable?
		- Bring the system back online; how far back does the data hp?
		- The database is up, but only provides the last twelve months of data
- Mean time to repair (MTTR)
	- Average time required to fix an issue
	- This includes time spent diagnosing the problem
	- An important metric for determining the cost and time associated with unplanned outages
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
	- The time between outages
	- Can be used as a prediction or calculated based on historical performance
	- Total uptime /  number of breakdowns
	- Statistically plan for possible outages
