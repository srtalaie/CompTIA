## Qualitative risk assessment
- Identify significant risk factors
	- Ask opinions about the significance
	- Display visually with traffic ight grid or similar method
游댮= high
游리 = medium
游릭 = low

## Quantitative risk assessment
- ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)
	- How often do we think it will occur in a year
- Asset Value (AV)
	- The value of the asset to the organization
	- Includes the cost of the asset, the effect on company sales, potential regulatory fines, replacement cost, etc.
- Exposure Factor (EF)
	- The percentage of the value lost due to an incident
	- Losing a quarter of the value is .25
	- Losing the entire asset is 1.0
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
	- What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs?
	- Asset Value (AV) x Exposure Factor (EF)
	- Ex/ Laptop stolen = $1,000 (AV) x 1.0 (EF) = $1,000 (SLE)
- ALE (Annualized  Loss Expectancy)
	- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) x SLE
	- Seven laptops stolen a year (ARO) x $1,000 (SLE) = $7,000
- The business impact can be more than monetary
	- Quantitative vs. qualitative
## Impact
- Life
	- The most important consideration
- Property
	- The risk to buildings and assets
- Safety
	- Some environments are too dangerous to work
- Finance
	- The resulting financial cost
## Likelihood and probability
- Risk likelihood
	- A qualitative measurement of risk
	- Rare, possible, almost certain, etc.
- Risk probability
	- A quantitative measurement of risk
	- A statistical measurement
	- Can be based on historical performance e
- Often considered similar in scope
	- Can be used interchangeably in casual conversation
## Risk appetite and tolerance
- Risk appetite
	- A broad description of risk-taking deemed acceptable
	- The amount of accepted risk before taking any action to reduce that risk
- Risk appetite posture
	- Qualitative description for readiness to take risk
	- Conservative, neutral, and expansionary
- Risk tolerance
	- An acceptable variance (usually larger) from the risk appetite
- Risk appetite
	- A highway's speed limit
	- Government authorities have set the speed limit
	- The limit is an acceptable balance between safety and convenience
- Risk tolerance
	- Drivers will be ticketed when the speed limit is violated
	- Ticketing usually occurs well above the posted limit
	- The tolerance can change with road conditions, weather, traffic, etc.
## Risk register
- Every project has a plan, but also has risk
	- Identify and document the risk associated with each step
	- Apply possible solutions to the identified risks
	- Monitor the results
- Key risk indicator
	- Identify risks that could impact the organization
- Risk owners
	- Each indicator is assigned someone to manage the risk
- Risk threshold
	- The cost of mitigation is at least equal to the value gained by mitigation
