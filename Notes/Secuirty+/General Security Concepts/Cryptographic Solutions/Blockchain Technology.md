## The blockchain process
- A transaction is requested
- The transaction could be any digital transaction from transferring Bitcoins, medical records, data backups, or transferring house title information
- The transaction is sent to every computer (or node) in a decentralized network to be verified
- The verified transaction is added to a new block of data containing other recently verified transactions
- The block is added to the end of the Blockchain, which is then updated to all nodes in the network for security
- Transaction is complete
- If any blocks are altered, its hash and all following hashes in the chain are automatically recalculated
- The altered chain will no longer match the chains stored by the rest of the network, and will be rejected
