## AAA Framework
- Identification
	- This is who you claim to be
	- Usually your username
- Authentication
	- Prove you are who you say you are
	- Password and other authentication factors
- Authorization
	- Based on your identification and authentication, what access do you have?
- Accounting
	- Resources used: Login time, data sent and received, logout time
## Authenticating People
- Provide username/password
- AAA Server - server holding all user authentication info (usernames and passwords)
	- When someone is trying to gain access the firewall/VPN Concentrator sends the info to the AAA server, if the credentials match the server returns with an approval
- Access is then given to the server
## Authenticating Systems
- You have to manage many devices
	- Often devices that you'll never physically see
- A system can't type a password
	- And you may not want to store one
- How can you truly authenticate a device
	- Put a digitally signed certificate on the device
- Other business processes rely on the certificate
	- Access to the VPN from authorized devices
	- Management software can validate the end device
## Certificate Authentication
- An organization has a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
	- Most organizations maintain their own CAs
- The organization creates a certificate for a device
	- And digitally signs the certificate with the organization's CA
- The certificate can now be included on a device as an authentication factor
	- The CA's digital signature is used to validate the certificate
- The CA itself will have its own certificate signed by the Root CA
## Authorization Models
- The user or device has now authenticated
	- To what do they now have access?
	- Time to apply an authorization model
- Users and services -> data and applications
	- Associating individual users to access rights does not scale
- Put an authorization model in the middle
	- Define by riles, Organizations, Attributes, etc.
- No authorization model?
	- A simple relationship
		- User -> Resource
	- Some issues with this method
		- Difficult to understand why an authorization may exist
		- Does not scale
	- In order to scale you need to add an abstraction
		- Abstraction
			- Reduce complexity
			- Creates a clear relationship between the user and the resource
		- Administration is streamlined
			- Easy to understand the authorizations
			- Support any number of users or resources
