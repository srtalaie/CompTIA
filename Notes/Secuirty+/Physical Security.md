- Channel people through a specific access point
	- And keep out other things

	- Moats

	- Consider overall light levels
	- Lighting angles may be important
		- Important for facial recognition
	- Avoid shadows and glare
## Sensors
- Infrared
	- Detects infrared radiation in both light and dark
	- Common in motion detectors
- Pressure
	- Detects a change in force
	- Floor and window sensors
- Microwave
	- Detects movement across large areas
- Ultrasonic
	- Send ultrasonic signals, receive reflected sound waves
	- Detect motion, collision detection, etc.
