## Change Management
- How to make a change
	- ex/ Upgrade software, patch an application, change firewall configuration, modify switchport
- One of the most common risks in the enterprise
	- Occurs very frequently
- Often overlooked or ignored
	- Did you feel that bite?
- Have clear policies
	- Frequency, duration installation process, rollback procedures
- Sometimes extremely difficult to implement
	- It's hard to change corporate culture
## Change approval process
- A formal process for managing change
	- Avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes
- A typical approval process
	- Complete the request forms
	- Determine the purpose of the change
	- Identify the scope of the change
	- Schedule a date and time of the change
	- Determine affected systems and the impact
	- Analyze the risk associated with the change
	- Get approval from the change control board
	- Get end-user acceptance after the change is complete
## Ownership
- An individual or entity needs to make a change
	- They own the process
	- They don't (usually) perform the actual change
- The owner manages the process
	- Process updates are provided to the owner
	- Ensures the process is followed and acceptable
- ex/ Address label printers needs to be upgraded
	- Shipping and Receiving department owns the process
	- IT handles the actual change
## Stakeholders
- Who is impacted by this change?
	- They'll want to have input on the change management process
- This may not be as obvious as you might think
	- A single change can include one individual or the entire company
- ex/ Upgrade software used for shipping labels affects:
	- Shipping/receiving
	- Accounting reports
	- Product delivery timeframes
	- Revenue recognition - CEO visibility
## Impact Analysis
- Determine a risk value
	- i.e., high, medium, low
- The risk can be minor or far-reaching
	- The "fix" doesn't actually fix anything
	- The fix breaks something else
	- Operating system failures
	- Data corruption
- What's the risk with NOT making the change?
	- Security vulnerability
	- Application unavailability
	- Unexpected downtime to other services
## Test results
- Sandbox testing environment
	- No connection to the real world or production system
	- A technological safe space
- Use before making a change to production
	- Try the upgrade, apply the patch
	- Test and confirm before deployment
- Confirm the backout plan
	- Move everything back to the original state
	- A sandbox can't consider every possibility
## Backout plan
- The change will work perfectly and nothing will ever go bad
	- Of course it will
- You should always have a way to revert your changes
	- Prepare for the worst, hope for the best
- This isn't as easy as it sounds
	- Some changes are difficult to revert
- Always have backups
	- Always have good backups
## Maintenance window
- When is the change happening?
	- This might be the most difficult part of the process
- During the workday may not be the best option
	- Potential downtime would affect a large part of production
- Overnights are often a better choice
	- Challenging for 24-hour production schedules
- The time of year may be a consideration
	- Retail networks are frozen during the holiday season
## Standard operating procedure
- Change management is critical
	- Affects everyone in the organization
- The process must be well documented
	- Should be available on the Intranet
	- Along with all standard processes and procedures
- Change to the process are reflected in the standards
	- A living document
