## Capacity planning
- Match supply to the demand
- Too much demand
	- Application slowdowns and outages
- Too much supply
	- You're paying too much
- Requires a balanced approach
	- Add the right amount of people
	- Apply appropriate technology
	- Build the best infrastructure
## People
- Some services require human intervention
	- Call center support lines
	- Technology services
- Too few employees
	- Recruit new staff
	- It may be time consuming to add more staff
- Too many employees
	- Redeploy to other parts of the organization
	- Downsize
## Technology
- Pick a technology that can scale
	- Not all services can easily grow and shrink
- Web services
	- Distribute the load across multiple web services
- Database services
	- Cluster multiple SQL servers
	- Split the database to increase capacity
- Cloud services
	- Service on demand
	- Seemingly unlimited resources (if you pay the money)
## Infrastructure
- The underlying framework
	- Application servers, network services, etc.
	- CPU, network, storage
- Physical devices
	- Purchase, configure, and install
- Cloud-based devices
	- Easier to deploy
	- Useful for unexpected capacity changes
