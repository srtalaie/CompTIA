## Power resiliency
- Power is the foundation of our technology
	- It's important to properly engineer and plan for outages
- We usually don't make our own power
	- Power is likely provided by third-parties
	- We can't control power availability
- There are ways to mitigate power issues
	- Short power outages
	- Long term power outages
## UPS
- Uninterruptible Power Supply
	- Short-term backup power
	- Blackouts, brownouts, surges
- UPS types
	- Offline/Standby UPS - connected to the main power, can switch on and take over when the power goes out
	- Line-interactive UPS - slowly increase amount of voltage if you see a drop in you main power line
	- On-line/Double-conversion UPS - always running
- Features
	- Auto shutdown, battery capacity, outlets, phone line suppression
## Generators
- Long-term power backup
	- Fuel storage required
- Power an entire building
	- Some power outlets may be marked as generator-powered
- It may take a few minutes to get the generator up to speed
	- Use a battery UPS while the generator is starting
