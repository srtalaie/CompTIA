## Recovery testing
- Test yourselves before an actual event
	- Scheduled update sessions (annual, semi-annual, etc.)
- Use well-defined rules of engagement
	- Do not touch the production systems
- Very specific scenario
	- Limited time to run the event 
- Evaluate response
	- Document and discuss
## Tabletop exercise
- Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly
	- And time consuming
- Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis
	- You don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill
- Get key players together for a tabletop exercise
	- Talk through a simulated disaster
## Fail over
- A failure is often inevitable
	- It's when", not "if"
- Used to check to see if redundant systems will work properly in instances of failure
- We may be able to keep running
	- Plan for the worst
- Create a redundant infrastructre
	- Multiple routers, firewalls, switches, etc.
- If one stiops working, fail over to the operational unit
	- Many infrastructure devices and services can do this automatically
## Simulations
- Test with a simulated event
	- Phishing attack, password request, data breaches
- Going phishing
	- Create a phishing email attack
	- Send to your actual user community
	- See who bites
- Test internal security
	- Did the phishing get past the filter?
- Test the user
	- Who clicked?
	- Additional training may be required
## Parallel processing
- Split a process through multiple (parallel) CPUs
	- A single computer with multiple CPU cores or multiple physical CPUs
	- Multiple computers
- Improved performance
	- Split complex transactions across multiple processors
- Improved recovery
	- Quickly identify a faulty system
	- Take the faulty device out of the list of available processors
	- Continue operating with the remaining processors
