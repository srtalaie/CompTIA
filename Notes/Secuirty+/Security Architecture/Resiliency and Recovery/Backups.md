## Backups
- Incredibly important
	- Recover important and valuable data
	- Plan for disaster
- Many different implementations
	- Total amount of data
	- Type of backup
	- Backup media
	- Storage location
	- Backup and recovery software
	- Day of the week
## Onsite vs. offsite backups
- On site backups
	- No internet link required
	- Data is immediately available
	- Generally less expensive than off site
- Off site backups
	- Transfer data over internet or WAN link
	- Data is available after a disaster
	- Restoration can be performed from anywhere
- Organizations often use both
	- More copies of the data
	- More options when restoring
## Frequency
- How often to backup
	- Every week, day , hour?
- This may be different between systems
	- Some systems may not change much each day
- May have multiple backup sets
	- Daily, weekly, and monthly
- This requires significant planning
	- Multiple backup sets across different days
	- Lots of media to manage
## Encryption
- A history of data is on backup media
	- Some of this media may be offsite
- This makes it very easy for an attacker
	- All of the data is in one place
- Protect backup data using encyption
	- Everything on the backup media is unreadable
	- The recovery key is required to restore the data
- Especially useful for cloud backups and storage
	- Prevent anyone from eavesdropping
## Snapshots
- Became popular on virtual machines
	- Very useful in cloud environments
- Take a snapshot
	- An instant backup of an entire system
	- Save the current configuration and data
- Take another snapshot after 24 hours
	- Contains only the changes between snapshots
- Take a snapshot every day
	- Revert to any snapshot
	- Very fast recovery
## Recovery testing
- It's not enough to perform the backup
	- You have to be able to restore to them
- Disaster recovery testing
	- Simulate a disaster situation
	- Restore from backup
- Confirm the restoration
	- Test the restored application and data
- Perform periodic audits
	- Always have a good backup
	- Weekly, monthly, quarterly checks
## Replication
- An ongoing, almost real-time backup
	-  Keep data synchronized in multiple locations
- Data is available
	- There's always a copy somewhere
- Data can be stored locally to all users
	- Replicate data to all remote sites
- Data is recoverable
	- Disasters can happen any time
## Journaling
- Power goes out while writing data to storage
	- The stored data is probably corrupted
- Recovery could be complicated
	- Remove corrupted files, restore from backup
- Before writing to storage, make a journal entry
	- After the journal is written, write the data to storage
- After the data is written to storage, update the journal
	- Clear the entry and get ready for the next entry
