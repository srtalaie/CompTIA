## Cloud responsibility matrix
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform  as a Service), SaaS (Software  as a Service), etc.
	- Who is responsible for security?
- Security should be well documented
	- Most cloud providers provide a matrix of responsibilities
	- Everyone knows up front
- These responsibilities can vary
	- Different cloud providers
	- Contractual agreements
## Hybrid considerations
- Hybrid cloud
	- More than one public or private cloud
	- This adds additional complexity
- Network protection mismatches
	- Authentication across platforms
	- Firewall configurations
	- Server settings
- Different security monitoring
	- Logs are diverse and cloud-specific
- Data leakage
	- Data is shared across the public internet
## Third-party vendors in the cloud
- You, the cloud, and third parties
	- Infrastructure technologies
	- Cloud based appliances
- Ongoing vendor risk assessments
	- Part of an overall vendor risk management policy
- Include third-party impact for incident response
	- Everyone is part of the process
- Constant monitoring
	- Watch for changes and unusual activity
## Infrastructure as code
- Describe an infrastructure
	- Defines servers, network, and applications as code
- Modify the infrastructure and create versions
	- The same way you version application code
- Use the description (code) to build other application instances
	- Build it the same way every time based on the code
- An important concept for cloud computing
	- Build a perfect version every time
## Serverless architecture
- Function as a Service (FaaS)
	- Applications are separated into individual, autonomous functions
	- Remove the operating system from the equation
- Developer still creates the server-side logic
	- Runs in a stateless computer container
- May be event triggered and ephemeral
	- May only run for one event
- Managed by a third-party
	- All OS security concerns are at the third-party
## Microservices and APIs
- Monolithic applications
	- One big application that does everything
	- Application contains all decision making processes
		- User interface
		- Business logic
		- Data input and output
	- Code challenges
		- Large codebase
		- Change control challenges
- Microservice Architecture
	- APIs
		- Application Programming Interfaces
		- API is the "glue" for the microservices
			- Work together to act as the application
		- Scalable
			- Scale just the microservices you need
		- Resilient
			- Outages are contained
		- Security and compliance
			- Containment is built-in
