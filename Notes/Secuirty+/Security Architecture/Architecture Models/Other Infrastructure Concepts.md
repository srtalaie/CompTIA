## Attacks can happen anywhere
- Two categories for IT security
	- On-premise data
	- Cloud-based data
- Cloud-based security is centralized and costs less
	- No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure
	- A third-party handles everything
- On-premises puts the security burden on the client
	- Data center and security and infrastructure costs
- Attackers don't care where the security is
## On-premise security
- Customize your own security posture
	- Full control when everything is in-house
- On-site IT team can manage security better
	- The local team can ensure everything is secure
	- A local team though can be expensive and difficult to staff
- Local team maintains uptime and availability
	- System checks can occur at any time
	- No phone call for support
- Security changes can take time
	- New equipment, configurations and additional costs
## Centralized vs. decentralized
- Most organizations are physically decentralized
	- Many locations, cloud providers, operating systems, etc.
- Difficult to manage and protect so many diverse systems
	- Centralize the security management
- A centralized approach
	- Correlated alerts
	- Consolidated log file analysis
	- Comprehensive system status and maintenance/patching
- It's not perfect
	- Single point of failure, potential performance issues
## Virtualization
- Virtualization
	- Run many different operating systems on the same hardware
- Each application instance has its own operating system
	- Adds overhead and complexity
	- Virtualization is relatively expensive
- How it is structured
	- On the physical device or infrastructure in which all VMs (Virtual Machines) are built off of and will run on
	- A hypervisor is software that sits on top of that infrastructure and it is responsible to manage all the resources between each VM
	- Each VM has its own guest operating system
	- Applications are then ran on VMs environment
## Application containerization
- Container
	- Contains everything you need to run an application
	- Code and dependencies
	- A standardized unit of software
- How it works
	- There is a physical device or infrastructure in which each container will be built off of
	- On top of the physical device is the host operating system
	- Above the host operating system is the containerization software that manages the relationship between the OS and the applications
- An isolated process in a sandbox
	- Self-contained
	- Apps can't interact with each other
- Container image
	- A standard for portability
	- Lightweight, uses the host kernel
	- Secure separation between applications
## Virtualization vs. containerization
- Both have hardware or infrastructure as a bottom layer in which everything will run off of
- For virtualization, a hypervisor sits on top of that hardware while a host operating system sits on top of the hardware for containerization
- In containerization on top of that host operating system sits the containerization software (i.e. Docker) which manages all of the different apps that are running on the system
- In virtualization the guest operating systems are running as their separate entities on each virtual machine
## IoT (Internet of Things)
- Devices that are integrated into your network and support features and services you use on a day to day basis
- Sensors
	- Heating and cooling, lighting
- Smart devices
	- Nome automation, video doorbells
- Wearable technology
	- Watches, health monitors
- Facility automation
	- Temperature, air quality, lighting
- Weak defaults
	- IoT manufacturers are not security professionals
## SCADA/ICS
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
	- Large-scale, multi-site Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
- PC manages equipment
	- Power generation, refining, manufacturing equipment
	- Facilities, industrial, energy, logistics
- Distributed control systems
	- Real-time information
	- System control
- Requires extensive segmentation
	- No access from the outside
## RTOS (Real Time Operating System)
- An operating system with a deterministic processing schedule
	- No time to wait for other processes
	- Industrial equipment, automobiles (ABS systems)
	- Military environments
- Extremely sensitive to security issues
	- Non-trivial systems
	- Need to always be available
	- Difficult to know what type of security is in place
## Embedded systems
- Hardware and software designed for a specific function
	- Or to operate as part of a larger system
- Is built with only this task in mind
	- Can be optimized for size and/or cost
- Common examples
	- Traffic light controllers
	- Digital watches
	- Medical imaging systems
## High availability
- Redundancy doesn't always mean always available
	- May need to be powered on manually
- HA (High Availability)
	- Always on, always available
- May include many different components working together
	- Active/Active can provide scalability advantages
- Higher availability almost always means higher costs
	- There's always another contingency you could add
	- Upgraded power, high-quality server components, etc.
