## The universal security control
- Standard issue
	- Home, office, and in your operating system
- Control the flow of network traffic
	- Everything passes through the firewall
- Corporate control of outbound and inbound data'
	- Sensitive materials
- Control of inappropriate content
	- Not safe for work, parental controls
- Protection against evil
	- Anti-virus, anti-malware
## Network-based firewalls
- OSI Layers:
	- Layer 1 - physical
	- Layer 2 - data link
	- Layer 3 - network
	- Layer 4 - transport
	- Layer 5 - session
	- Layer 6 - presentation
	- Layer 7 - application
- Filter traffic by port number or application
	- OSI layer 4 (TCP port or UDP port number) vs. OSI layer 7 (Application layer)
	- Traditional vs. NGFW firewalls
- Encrypt traffic
	- VPN between sites
- Most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)
	- Often sits on the ingress/egress of the network
	- Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality
	- Authenticate dynamic routing communication
## UTM/All-in-one security appliance
- Unified Threat Management (UTM)/Web security gateway
	- URL filter/Content inspection
	- Malware inspection
	- Spam filter
	- CSU/DSU
	- Router, Switch
	- Firewall
	- IDS/IPS
	- Bandwidth shaper
	- VPN endpoint
- Only operate at layer 4 (port numbers); with all these capabilities it affects performance
## Next-generation firewall (NGFW)
- The OSI Application Layer (7)
	- All data in every packet
- Can be called different names
	- Application layer gateway
	- Stateful multilayer inspection
	- Deep packet inspection
- Requires some advanced decodes
	- Every packet mist be analyzed and categorized before a security decision is determined
## NGFWs
- Network-based Firewalls
	- Control traffic flows based on the application
		- ex/ of decisions it can make:  Microsoft SQL Server regardless of port, can view but not post on Twitter, can allow or restrict anyone from viewing YouTube videos
		- It is possible all 3 of those are using the same port numbers, but the NGFW looks at the application and doesn't necessarily rely on using a port number to make forwarding decisions 
- Intrusion Prevention Systems
	- Identify the application
	- Apply application-specific vulnerability signatures to the traffic
- Content filtering
	- URL filters
	- Control website traffic by category (i.e. prevent anyone from visiting a gambling site)
## Web application firewall (WAF)
- Not like a "normal" firewall
	- Applies rules to HTTP/HTTPS conversations
- Allow or deny based on expected input
	- Unexpected input is a common method of exploiting an application
- SQL injection
	- Add your commands to an application's SQL query
	- WAF can recognize and block SQL injections within a traffic flow4
- A major focus of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Most commonly used in conjunction with NGFWs
