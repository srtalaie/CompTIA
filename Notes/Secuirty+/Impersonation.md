## The pretext
- Before the attack, the trap is set
	- There's an actor and a story
-  ex/ “Hello, sir. My name is Wendy. And I’m from Microsoft Windows. This is an urgent checkup call for your computer as we have found several problems with it.”
- ex/ “This is an enforcement action executed by the US Treasury intending your serious attention.”
- ex/  “Congratulations on your excellent payment history.” “You now qualify for 0% interest rates on all of your credit card accounts.”
## Impersonation
- Attackers pretend to be someone they aren't
	- Halloween for the fraudsters
- Use some of those details from reconnaissance
	- You can trust me, I'm with your help desk
- Attack the victim as someone higher in rank
	- Office of the Vice President for Scamming
- Throw tons of technical details around
	- Catastrophic feedback due to the depolarization of the differential magnetometer
- Be a buddy
	- How about those Cubs?
## Eliciting information
- Extracting information from the victim
	- The victim doesn't even realize this is happening
	- Hacking the human
- Often seen with vishing (Voice Phishing)
	- Can be easier to get this information over the phone
- These are well-documented psychological techniques
	- They can't just ask, "So what's your password?"
## Identity fraud
- Your identity can be used by others
	- Keep your personal information safe!
- Credit card fraud
	- Open an account in your name, or use your credit card information
- Bank fraud
	- Attacker gains access to your account or opens a new account
- Loan fraud
	- Your information is used for a loan or lease
- Government benefits fraud
	- Attacker obtains benefits on your behalf
## Protect against impersonation
- Never volunteer information
