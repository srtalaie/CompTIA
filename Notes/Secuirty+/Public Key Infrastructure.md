## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people responsible for:
	- Digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke
- This is a big, big endeavor
	- Lots of planning
- Also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices
	- The certificate authority
	- Its all about trust
## Symmetric Encryption
- A single, shared key
	- Encrypt with the key
	- Decrypt with the same key
	- If it gets our, you'll need another key
- Secret key algorithm
	- A shared secret
- Doesn't scale very well
	- Can be challenging to distribute
	- ~10 individuals/devices
- Very fast to use
	- Less overhead than asymmetric encryption
	- Often combined with asymmetric encryption
## Asymmetric Encryption
- Public key cryptography
	- Two (or more) mathematically related keys
- Private key
	- Keep this key private
- Public Key
	- Anyone can see this key
	- Give it away
- The private key is the only key that can decrypt data encrypted with the public key
	- You can't derive the private key from the public key
## The Key Pair
- Asymmetric encryption
	- Public Key Cryptography
- Key generation
	- Build both the public and private key at the same time
	- Lots of randomization
	- Large prime numbers
	- Lots and lots of math
- Everyone can have the public key
	- Only you have the private key
- Workflow:
	- You send a plaintext message encrypted with the public key. This combination is called the ciphertext
	- The Ciphertext cannot be decrypted without a private key
	- Ciphertext is sent to someone and they use their private key to decrypt the ciphertext and read the plaintext message
## Key escrow
- Someone else holds your decryption keys
	- Your private keys are in the hands of a 3rd-party
	- This may be within your own organization
- This can be a legitimate business arrangement
	- A business might need access to employee information
	- Government agencies may need to decrypt partner data
- Controversial?
	- Of course
	- But may still be required
