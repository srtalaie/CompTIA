## Buffer overflows
- Occurs when the amount of data in the buffer exceeds its storage capacity**. That extra data overflows into adjacent memory locations and corrupts or overwrites the data in those locations.
- Overwriting a buffer of memory
	- Spills over into other memory areas
- Developers need to perform bounds checking
	- The attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings
- Not a simple exploit
	- Takes time to avoid crashing things
	- Takes time to make it do what you want
- A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable
	- Which means that a system can be compromised
