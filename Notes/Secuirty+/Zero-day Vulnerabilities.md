## Vulnerabilities
- Manu applications have vulnerabilities
	- We've just not found them yet
- Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability
	- The good guys share these with developers
## Zero-day attacks
- Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities
	- They create exploits against these vulnerabilities
- The vendor has no idea the vulnerability exists
	- They don't have a fix for an unknown problem
- Zero-day attacks
	- An attack without a patch or method of mitigation
	- A race to exploit the vulnerability or create a patch
	- Difficult to defend against the unknown
