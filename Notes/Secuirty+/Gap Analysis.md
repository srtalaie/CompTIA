	- The gap between the two
- This may require extensive research
- This can take weeks or months
	- An extensive study with numerous s participants'
	- Requires emails, data gathering and technical research
## Choosing the framework

- Identify weaknesses
	- Along with the most effective processes
- A detailed analysis

## The analysis and report
- The final comparison
	- Detailed baseline objectives
	- A clear view of the current state
- Need a path to get from the current security to the goal
	- Almost certainly include time, money, and lots of change control
- Time to create the gap analysis report
	- A formal description of the current state
	- Recommendations for meeting the baseline
