##  Security Objectives
- Confidentiality
	- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems
- Integrity
	- Messages can't be modified w/o detection
- Accessibility
	- Systems or networks must be up and running

		- Additional confirmation before info is disclosed
## Integrity
- Data is stored and transferred as intended
	- Examples:
		- Hashing
			- Map data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length
		- Digital Signatures
			- Mathematical scheme to verify integrity of data
		- Certificates
			- Combine with digital signatures to verify an individual 
		- Non-Repudiation
			- Provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine
## Availability
- Information is accessible to authorized users
	- Always at your finger tips
- Examples:
	- Redundancy
		- Build devices that will always be available
	- Fault Tolerance
		- System will continue to run even when failure occurs
	- Patching
		- Stability
		- Close security holes
