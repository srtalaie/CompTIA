## Mobile device security
- Challenging to secure
	- Often need additional security policies and systems
- Relatively small
	- Can be almost invisible
- Almost always in motion
	- You never know where it might be
- Packed with sensitive data
	- Personal and organizational
- Constantly connected to the Internet
## Jailbreaking/rooting
- Mobile devices are purpose-built systems
	- You don't have access to the operating system
- Gaining access
	- Android - Rooting
	- Apple iOS - Jailbreaking
- Install custom firmware
	- Replaces the existing operating system
- Uncontrolled access
	- Circumvent security features
	- The Mobile Device Manager (MDM) becomes relatively useless
## Sideloading
- Malicious apps can be a significant security concern
	- One Trojan horse can create a data breach
- Manage installation sources
	- The global or local app store
- Sideloading circumvents security
	- Apps can be installed manually without using an app store
	- Again, your MDM becomes relatively useless
