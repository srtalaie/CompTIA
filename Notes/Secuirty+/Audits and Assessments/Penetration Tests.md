## Physical penetration testing
- Operating system security can be circumvented by physical means
	- Modify the boot process
	- Boot from other media
	- Modify or replace OS files
- Physical security is key
	- Prevent access by unauthorized individuals
- Assess and test physical security
	- Can you enter a building without a key?
	- What access is available inside?
	- Doors, windows, elevators, physical security processes
## Penetrating perspectives
- Offensive
	- The red team
	- Attack the systems and look for vulnerabilities to exploit
- Defensive
	- The blue team
	- Identify attacks in real-time
	- Prevent any unauthorized access
- Integrated
- - Create an ongoing process
- Identify and patch exploitable systems and services
- Test again
## Working knowledge
- How much do you know about the test?
	- Many different approaches
- Known environment
	- Full disclosure
- Partially known environment
	- A mix of known and unknown
	- Focus on certain systems or applications
- Unknown environment
	- The pentester knows nothing about the systems under attack
	- "Blind test"
## Reconissance
- Need information before the attack
	- Can't rush blindly in
- Gathering a digital footprint
	- Learn everything you can
- Understand the security posture
	- Firewalls, security configurations
- Minimize the attack area
	- Focus on key systems
- Create a network map
	- Identify routers, networks, remote sites
## Passive reconissance
- Learn as much as you can from open sources
	- There's a lot of information out there
	- Remarkably difficult to protect or identify
- Social media
- Corporate website
- Online forums
- Social engineering
- Dumpster diving
- Business organizations
## Active reconnaissance
- Trying the doors
	- Maybe one is unlocked
	- Don't open it yet
	- Relatively easy to be seen
- Visible on network traffic and logs
- Ping scans, port scans
- DNS queries
- OS scans, OS fingerprinting
- Service scans, version scans
